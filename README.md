Stock Price Prediction using Deep Learning

Overview

This project implements Stock Price Prediction using LSTM, GRU, and Transformer models. The dataset is fetched from Yahoo Finance, and various deep learning models are trained to predict future stock prices.

Features

Fetches stock price data from Yahoo Finance.

Preprocesses and scales data for deep learning models.

Implements LSTM, GRU, and Transformer models for time-series forecasting.

Compares model performances and visualizes results.

Uses TensorFlow, Keras, and Matplotlib for deep learning and visualization.

Dataset

The stock price data is retrieved using the yfinance library. The default dataset used in this project is Apple (AAPL) stock prices from 2020-01-01 to 2024-01-01.

Installation

Requirements

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

pip install numpy pandas yfinance matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow keras

Or, install them from requirements.txt:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-prediction.git
cd stock-price-prediction

2. Run the Script

python stock_prediction.py

3. Modify Parameters

To change the stock ticker or date range, update the following lines in stock_prediction.py:

ticker = 'AAPL'  # Change to any stock symbol
data = yf.download(ticker, start='2020-01-01', end='2024-01-01')

Model Architectures

LSTM Model

Two LSTM layers with 50 units each

Dropout layer to prevent overfitting

Fully connected output layer

GRU Model

Two GRU layers with 50 units each

Dropout layer for regularization

Dense output layer

Transformer Model

Uses Multi-Head Attention and Layer Normalization

Fully connected layers for output prediction

Results and Visualization

The actual stock prices are compared with the predictions.

Results are plotted using Matplotlib.

Performance comparison between LSTM, GRU, and Transformer models.
